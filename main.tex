\ctparttext{We begin this part with a general introduction that stresses the
    ever growing importance of cities in the world, and highlights the
    difficulties encountered when trying to reach a scientific understanding of
    these systems. We briefly outline the history of the quantitative tradition
    in the study of urban systems, and argue that we may be witnessing a second
quantitative revolution. We then  succintly present the methodology that we
followed during the past 3 years, and end this part with an outline of the
content presented in this thesis.}

\ctparttext{

The monocentric model of cities -- where all activities are organised around a
single activity center -- has pervaded the literature on urban systems for more
than $4$ decades. However, as it was repeatedly demonstrated, the model is empirically
inadequate.

The contribution of this part is threefold. First, we recount the history of
ideas about urban form, from the monocentric hypothesis and its origins, to the
various methods proposed to identify and count subcenters. We then demonstrate
empirically the existence of a polycentric transition for cities, and that the
number of centers increases as a sublinear function of population size. Finally,
we propose an out-of-equilibrium model that explains the emergence of new
subcenters as cities expand, and predicts the sublinear increase of the number
of centers with population size.

\ctparttext{The past decade has witnessed a renewed interest for the scaling of some of cities' characteristics with population size
    -- first discovered more than $60$ years ago.

The contribution of this part is threefold. First, we review the exisiting
literature on allometric scalings, sorting the measured
exponents by theme. We then propose a model to explain the scaling exponent of several
indicators related to mobility in cities, and discuss the theoretical and
practical consequences of these exponents.  Finally, we present some of the
challenges posed by scaling relationships: their interpretation,
and the issues they reveal about the definition of cities.}

\ctparttext{Residential segregation is a reality. A reality so rife that it has
    pervaded even our every day language though the expressions 'poor
    neighbourhood' or 'rich neighbouhood'. But despite its intuitive appeal,
    segregation is difficult to define.\\ 
    In this part, we propose to define segregation as a deviation to the
    unsegregated city, thereby providing a firm theoretical basis for any
    study of segregation patterns. We further propose
    a measure of attraction/repulsion of the different categories, which allows us to
    define unambiguously income classes from the original categories. We also study the
properties of neighbourhoods in which the different classes concentrate, and revisit the traditional poor
center/rich suburb dichotomy.}

\ctparttext{People, energy, information and goods are carried through cities
    (and across systems of cities) thanks to various networks. In this part, we
    succintly present our work on these---spatial---networks. 
    
    We first propose a quantative method to classify cities that is based on a new
    perspective on street patterns, and the use of the OpenStreetMaps database. In
    the second chapter, we propose a model for the growth of spatial networks
    based on cost-benefit analysis. The resulting networks exhibit a crossover
    between the star graph and the minimum spanning tree when the ratio of costs
    and benefits evolve. In the intermediate regime, the networks adopt a
    hub-and-spoke hierarchical structure that has many interesting properties.
    We conclude this part with a large-scale description of subway and
    railway networks. Using the model presented in the previous chapter, we are
    able to predict many of their properties based on the characteristics of the
underlying city or country.}

%Rather, they interact in what has been called a system of cities. In this part,

%and show some unexpected consequences. Last, but not least, we show how Zipf's
