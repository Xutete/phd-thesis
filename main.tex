\ctparttext{The study of urban systems is changing at a fast pace, due to the
use of new sources of data. Or is it really? In this part, I will briefly
outline the history of the quantitative tradition in the study of urban systems,
and argue that we may be witnessing a second quantitative revolution. I will
briefly expose the methodoly, giving concrete examples of why this methodology
should be followed. I end the part with a collection of puzzles about urban
systems that I attempt to solve in the rest of the manuscript.} % Text on the Part 1 page describing  the content in Part 1

\ctparttext{

The monocentric model of cities -- where all activities are organised around a
single activity center -- has pervaded the literature on urban systems for more
than $4$ decades. However, as it was repeatedly demonstrated, the model is empirically
inadequate.

The contribution of this part is threefold. First, we trace the history of ideas
regarding urban form, from the monocentric hypothesis and its origins, to the
various methods proposed to identify and count subcenters. We then demonstrate
empirically the existence of a polycentric transition for cities, and that the
number of centers increases as a sublinear function of the population size of
cities. Finally, we propose an out-of-equilibrium model that explains the
emergence of new subcenters as cities expand, and predicts the sublinear
increase of the number of centers with population size.

\ctparttext{Scaling of indicators with the population size of the city has been
recently re-discovered and explored by the different communities. In this part,
the contribution are threefold. First, a review of the exisiting literature,
pre- and post-2007 on scalings and their interpretation. Then, a model to
explain the scaling of several indicators related to mobility in cities. We then
discuss some results, Zahavi's constant and Newman and Kenworthy's famous curve.
Finally, we show that scalings pose the question of how we should define cities
as systems.} % Text on the Part 2 page describing the content in Part 2

\ctparttext{Segregation is a notion that is difficult to define, hence the
extensive literature concerning segregation in the literature. In this part, we
propose to measure segregation as a deviation to the unsegregated city. We thus
provide a strong theoretical basis for the location coefficient. We further
derive a measure of attraction of the different categories, that allows us to
define unambiguously classes for the original categories. We study the
properties of neighbourhoods of different classes. We revisit the poor
center/rich suburb distinction. Finally, we propose a new measure of segregation
that takes space into account.}

%\ctparttext{Cities and systems of cities are irrigated in people, energy,
%information and goods thanks to various spatial networks. In this part, we show
%how a new perspective on street patterns, and the use of OpenStreetMaps'
%database allow us to provide a classification of cities based on their street
%pattern. We then propose a large-scale description of subway and railway
%networks, and are able to predict many of their properties based on the
%properties of the underlying city or country.} % Text on the Part 2 page describing the content in Part 2

%\ctparttext{Cities are not closed systems. Neither do they evolve in isolation.
%Rather, they interact in what has been called a system of cities. In this part,
%we focus on the movements of populations inside a system of city. We sutyd the
%network of residential migrations in the US, describe some of its properties,
%and show some unexpected consequences. Last, but not least, we show how Zipf's
%law finds a natural explanation in when considering the motion of people.} % Text on the Part 2 page describing the content in Part 2
