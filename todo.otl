INTRODUCTION
	New data?
		Trajectory Mobile phone data
		Precision --> Cell Tower and Census Block
			IRIS/Mobile Phone Paris
			Idem smaller aire urbain with fewer antennas
		Better for aggregate quantities, evolution in time (Louail et al.)
		: Access to the time dimension. And to *all* trips

POLYCENTRICITY
	How strong polycentric pattern 
		Density from the center of gravity
		Thresholded figure showing several centers (Los Angeles!)
	[X] Extract the number of centers from 2000 MSA
	Fujita et Ogawa
		Calculation maximisation of utility (look at Brueckner, Glaeser papers).
		Have a look at AMM theory
			Download Fujita, Venables, etc
			Download Fujita, Thisse
	Figure showing contiguous tracts counted as different centers.

SCALING
	Introduction
		Discuss model of Bettencourt and others
	Do not forget Newman and Kenworthy!
	Interpretation
		Plot scaling of wages and scaling of income
		: Illustrate the effect of flows in the system of cities
		: on scalings.
	Normalise Y0 for cities of different countries... Data?

SEGREGATION
	Text
		Distinction Concentration/Proportion/Representation
		Exposure as a measure of interaction
		Extract the class structure
		Extract neighbourhoods
		Clustering
		Density
		A new measure of segregation
			Self-dissimilarity (Evenness)
			Earth Mover's distance
	Conclusion
		Reflection on the way to cluster categories together
	Add figures
	Add figures on Earth Moving distance?
