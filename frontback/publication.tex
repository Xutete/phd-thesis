This thesis was the occasion to tackle other subjects, that I deliberately chose
not to address in the present dissertation. This work appeared in the following
publications:\\

[1] Emergence of hierarchy in cost-driven growth of spatial networks
[2] A typology of street patterns
[3] Scaling in transportation networks
[4] Group-outcome decision making...\\

Some of it will be the topic of a book that is being written at the same time as
this manuscript.\\

[1] Shape and growth of urban street patterns
