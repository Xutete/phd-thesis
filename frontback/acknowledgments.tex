\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text


Although the scientific method urges otherwise, it is very difficult to separate
the work that you have done to the context in which it was done. Late at night,
changing the presentation of a few results, adjusting a figure or staring at the
blinking cursor that hasn't moved for too long now, it is difficult not to
remember where this idea came through, when I first saw the results of this
calculation, what was going on out of the lab when I was writing this code.
These details hardly matter to anyone, but they do matter to me. And a bit of
background won't hurt. Thesis acknowledgements are traditionally the occasion
for students to let they 'true selves' out for a few lines, pages. This is maybe
one of the few traditions I gladly take part in. I am gladly
taking this opportunity to pay tribute to the last $3$ years, to the pains, the
joys, disappointments, illusions losts, the lines of codes and new friendships.
To the continuity, rather than the rupture. And to the mistakes, soon replaced
by more mistakes.  Hopefully more elaborate.\\



Enfin---pardon my french---je tiens \`{a} remercier mes parents, qui, plus
peut-etre que les efforts combin\'es de toutes les personnes sus-cit\'ees, ont
amplement contribué à cette thèse, bien qu'indirectement. Il m'arrive souvent de
regarder en arrière et de rejouer ma trajectoire personnelle si vous n'aviez pas
été là. Si vous n'aviez pas ete qui vous etes. Aucune ne se termine ici, devant
mon ordinateur, a tapper les derniers mots de cette these.

            me row at Oxford's Summer VIII's and replace horrible thoughts about
            my dissertation by equally horrible though about erging.

\noindent Many thanks to the Open Source community, without which I would not
have been able to do even a half of this thesis. The developpers behind linux,
for providing such a stable and efficient system. The developpers of Python and
of the many python libraries. All the work I have done has been made possible by
the selfless work of many before me.
