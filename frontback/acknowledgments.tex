I would first and foremost like to express my gratitude to Alain Barrat, Michael
Batty, Pablo Jensen, Renaud Lambiotte, Jean-Pierre Nadal and Lena Sanders for accepting to be in
my thesis committee. I can only imagine how daunting reading a PhD thesis must
be, and I am really grateful for their time and for helping me to jump over this
last hurdle. I sincerely hope this was not as awful as reading a 200 pages
document (written by a student) sounds.\\

Thank you, also, to the Institut de Physique Th\'eorique. By that, I mean its
director Michel Bauer, the PhD coordinators Olivier Golinelli and St\'ephane
Nonnenmacher, and the incredibly efficient (and kind!) administrative and IT
staff.\\

This thesis would not have been the same without the supervision of Marc
Barthelemy. I still remember the sunny, winter morning of 2012 when the bus
droppped me in the middle of nowhere, not far from the Institut de Physique
Th\'eorique. The fields were frozen, and vaguely white. I remember thinking, as
I stepped out of the bus and felt the cold air biting my face, that this was
going to be temporary. Needless to say, I did not sign up for three more years
because of my love of long commutes, or the (too) familiar smell of the RER B. Neither
was it for the office with a view, not on the fields---or the odd rabbit coming
out of the nearby forest---, but on a brick wall. And faded flowers. 

Now that this thesis is coming to end, I do know why I stayed, what I am
grateful for. I am grateful to Marc for his trust, and for giving me the
appreciated freedom to choose and explore the topics I liked. I am thankful, not
only for his scientific supervision, our insightful discussions, but also for
teaching me the things that cannot be found in textbooks: how to navigate the
research world. Marc also knew when to push me and how to push me, and this is
hopefully reflected in the work presented here. I am greatly indebted to him.\\


Je tiens \`{a} remercier mes parents, sans qui, plus encore que toutes les
personnes sus-cit\'ees, cette th\`ese n'existerait pas.  Souvent (!), on me
demande: ``Comment est-ce qu'un fils d'agriculteur fait pour devenir
physicien?''.  Je ne sais pas exactement, parce que c'est juste arriv\'e, et
parce que cela a pris tant d'ann\'ees. Je sais en revanche---c'est ce que je
r\'eponds souvent---que c'est que \c{c}a n'aurait jamais \'et\'e possible sans
vous, et l'\'education que vous m'avez donn\'ee. Vous m'avez offert le plus
beau et le plus utile des cadeaux. Merci. Je vous en suis infiniment
reconnaissant.

I finally wanted to thank Nikki, Cl\'ement, Pu, Rosa-L\`y, K\'evin (and my
parents, again) for being there when it really mattered. And all my other
friends and colleagues, for being there.\\
