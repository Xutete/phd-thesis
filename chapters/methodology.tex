\section{In defense of reductionism}

In fact, we do not need to have a full theoretical description of the human mind
to say something about the actions of hundreds of thousands, a million of them.
In the same way we do not need string theory in order to explain the
functioning of living organisms.

\graffito{An example of side note}
In `Againt Method', the philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend argued against
the idea that Science proceeds through the application of a single, monolithic
method; what people usually call `The Scientific Method'. The reference is not
innocent, and I will argue here that, although empirical analysis constitutes
the alpha and the omega of our enquiry for knowledge, data are not enough.  


Fancy words are too often used as a substitute for a real
understanding of the system. But, however intellectually appealing they are,
metaphors are not a theory. What do we understand from the comparison of cities
with biological systems? What new knowledge do we gain? Sure, the most important
ideas are those that you trigger, but you are responsible for the way your ideas
are interpreted.  Maybe cities are an easy pray for this sort of behaviour.
Since there is very little understandin, and the immediacy, complexity and
diversity of out experiences with cities creates this big gap in which anyone
can slip an idea or two, that will be interpreted in very different ways by
different people. The genius of metaphors is not to provide interesting ideas
that are ready to be applied to a specific fiedld. Rather, it is to trigger very
different ideas into different people. But this when we should realise the power
of the metaphor and leave it behind, following the trail of the new ideas thus
triggered. What we need to highlight are regularities, not similarities.
In the following manuscript, I will therefore pay a special attention to the
rigour in the language used. Qualify suggestions, by presenting them as such.
This kind of work may be less suggestive, the vocabulary used less expressive,
it may not make the reader feel as good about herself, but it is a necessary
step towards a science of cities. We need to clear the language of unfruitful
metaphors and fill the gap with mechanisms.
