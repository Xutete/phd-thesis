The success of natural sciences lies in their great emphasis on the role of
quantifiable data and their interplay with models. Data and models are both
necessary for the progress of our understanding: data generate stylized facts
and put constraints on models. Models on the other hand are essential to
comprehend the processes at play and how the system works. If either is missing,
our understanding and explanation of a phenomenon are questionable. This issue
is very general, and affects all scientific domains, including the study of
cities. \\

Until recently, the field of urban economics essentially consisted in untested
laws and theories, unjustified concepts that supersede empirical
evidence~\cite{Bouchaud:2008}. Without empirical validation, it is not clear
what these models teach us about cities. The tide has turned in recent years,
however: the availability of data is increasing in size and specificity, which
has led to the discovery of new stylized facts and opened the door to a new
science of cities~\cite{Batty:2013}. The recent craze for scaling
laws~\cite{Batty:2008,Bettencourt:2007,Pumain:2004}, for instance, has been an
important new step in the study of urban systems.

These laws present themselves as a power-law relationship between socioeconomic
(GDP, number of patents), structural (length of roads, of cables) quantities
$Y$, and the size of the population $P$ of the city:

\begin{equation}
Y = P^{\, \beta}
\end{equation}


where the exponent $\beta$ can be different from $1$. This type of scaling relation is a signature
of various processes governing the phenomenon under study, especially when the exponent
$\beta$ is not what is naively expected~\cite{Barenblatt:2003}. However, as more and more scaling
relationships are being reported in the literature, it becomes less and less clear what we really
learn from these empirical findings. Mechanistic insights about these scalings are usually
nonexistent, often leading to misguided interpretations.\\

levels. In red, the aggregation is done at the level of urban areas and in green for combined statistical
areas. Depending on the definition of the city, the scaling exponents are qualitatively different, leading
to two opposite conclusions. Data on $CO_2$ emissions were obtained from the Vulcan Project (\url{http://
vulcan.project.asu.ed}) (see~\cite{Fragkias:2013,Oliveira:2014}). Data on the population of urban areas and
metropolitan statistical areas were obtained from the Census Bureau (\protect\url{http://www.census.org}). \label{fig}}

Statistical Area (in grey) is defined as the counties containing the urban area
as well as any adjacent county that have a high degree of integration with the
core, as measured with commuting flows.\label{fig:two_definitions}}
\end{figure}

A striking example of the fallacies which hinder the interpretation and application
of scaling is given by different studies on $CO_2$ emissions due to transportation~\cite{Fragkias:2013,Glaeser:2010,Oliveira:2014,Rybski:2013}. The topic
is particularly timely: pollution peaks occur in large cities worldwide with a seemingly
increasing frequency, and are suspected to be the source of serious health problems~\cite{Bernstein:2004}. Glaeser and Kahn~\cite{Glaeser:2010}, Rybski et al~\cite{Rybski:2013}, Fragkias et al~\cite{Fragkias:2013}, and Oliveira et al~\cite{Oliveira:2014} are interested in how $CO_2$ emissions scale with the population size
of cities. The question they ask is simple: Are larger cities greener---in the sense that there
are fewer emissions per capita for larger cities---or smoggier? Surprisingly, these different
studies reach contradictory conclusions. We identify here two main sources of error which
originate in the lack of understanding of the mechanisms governing the phenomenon.

The first error concerns the estimation of the quantity $Q_{CO_2}$ of $CO_2$ emissions due to
transportation. In the absence of direct measures, Glaeser and Kahn~\cite{Glaeser:2010} have chosen
to use estimations of $Q_{CO_2}$ based on the total distance traveled by commuters. This is in fact
incorrect, and in heavily congested urban areas the relevant quantity is the total time spent
in traffic~\cite{Louf:2013}. Using distance leads to a serious underestimation of
$CO_2$ emissions: the effects of congestion are indeed strongly nonlinear, and the time spent
in traffic jams is not proportional to the traveled distance. As a matter of fact, commuting
distance and time scale differently with population size, and the time spent commuting and
$CO_2$ emissions scale with the same exponent~\cite{Louf:2014}.

The second, subtler, issue lies in the definition of the city itself, and over which
geographical area the quantities $Q_{CO_2}$ and $P$ should be aggregated. There is currently great
confusion in the literature about how cities should be defined, and scientists, let alone the
various statistical agencies in the world, have not yet reached a consensus. This is a crucial
issue as scaling exponents are very sensitive to the definition of the city~\cite{Arcaute:2013}. $CO_2$ emissions are no exception: aggregating over urban areas or metropolitan
statistical areas entails radically different behaviours (see figure~\ref{fig}). For the US, using the
definition of urban areas provided by the Census Bureau (\url{http://www.census.org}), one finds
that $CO_2$ emissions per capita sharply increase with population size, implying that larger
cities are less green. Using the definition of metropolitan statistical areas, also provided by
the Census Bureau, one finds that $CO_2$ emissions per capita decrease slightly with population
size, implying that larger cities are greener.\\



Faced with these two opposite results, what should one conclude? Our point is that, in
the absence of a convincing model that accounts for these differences and how they arise,
nothing. Scaling relationships, and more generally data analysis, have an important role
to play in the rising new science of cities. But, as the previous discussion illustrates, it is
dangerous to interpret empirical results without any mechanistic insight. Conclusions cannot
safely be drawn from data analysis alone.

From a policy point of view, now, what should one do to curb CO2 emissions? Favour
the growth of large urban areas or the repartition of population in less populated cities?
Both can be argued by considering data analysis alone. It should therefore be obvious that,
until they have a satisfactory understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the observed
behaviours, scientists should refrain from giving policy advice that might have unforeseen,
disastrous consequences. If they choose to do so anyway, policy makers should be wary
about what is, at best, a shot in the dark

\section{Properties of cities, or systems of cities?}
\label{sub:what_can_scalings_tell_us_about_cities_and_systems_of_cities_}

Before moving on to the models proposed to explain scaling laws, 
it is important to understand what exactly scaling laws can tell us about
cities. Scaling laws are, by essence, cross-sectionnal studies of cities. As
opposed to a dynamical study where one would follow the evolution of single
cities over time, scaling laws tells us about the behaviour of an
\emph{ensemble} of cities at a give point in time. Two main questions emerge
from a review of the existing literature:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do scalings tell us something about the growth of cities?
    \item Is the differentiation between cities implied by scalings due to
        intra-urban processes, or inter-urban processes?
\end{enumerate}

I will try to anwer these questions in the next two subsections.

\subsection{Scaling, not growth}
\label{sub:scaling_not_growth}

In the paper that became the reference in terms of
scalings~\cite{Bettencourt:2007}, Bettencourt and co-authors proposed a simple
model to model urban growth. Assume a given resource, whose quantity is noted
$Y$. If it requires $R$ units of resources to maintain an individual, and $E$ to
create a new individual, then assuming all resources are allocated, we have

\begin{equation}
    Y = R\,P + E\,\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}t}
    \label{eq:growth_resource_allocation}
\end{equation}

Assuming that the resource scales with population as in
Eq.~\ref{eq:scaling_definition}, we have for the growth rate

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}t} = \left(\frac{Y_0}{E}\right) P^{\,\beta} -
\left(\frac{R}{E}\right)P 
    \end{equation}

Equation whose solutions exhibit different qualitative behaviours depending on
the value of the exponent $\beta$. For $\beta < 1$, the total population
eventually reaches a finite limiting size; for $\beta = 1$ the solution reduces
to an exponential, and for $\beta > 1$ the equation leads to a
faster-than-exponential growth.\\
Denise Pumain rightfully questioned the link between scaling exponents and city
growth~\cite{Pumain:2012}. The objection she raises is on the ground of the link
between scalings and time evolution of the system, an implicit assumption in the
derivation of the previous differential equation. Put simply, the assumption is:
given a city with population $P$ at an instant $t$, which evolves in a system of
city which follows the law $Y = Y_0\,P^\beta$ at an instant $t$. If the
population of all cities evolve between $t$ and $t+1$, then the same scaling law
still holds---although the population of all cities have changed. She refutes
this hypothesis on two grounds: the first one, that scaling are not properties
of cities, but rather of the system of cities to which the cities belong and its
particular processes of redistribution leading to a spatial differentiation
between cities.  I will discuss this point in the next subsection. The next
argument is based on a misunderstanding of the role of the ergodic hypothesis in
equilibrium statistical mechanics. Pumain states that the previously explicited
hypothesis is based on an assumed equivalence between longitudinal trajectories and
cross-sectional measures, itself based on the egodic hypothesis. The ergodic
hypothesis is used in statistical physics to use time averages and averages over
statistical ensembles interchangeably. It states, roughly, that a system can
reach all possible states when the time of the experiment tends to $\infty$. If
it is verified then the time averages that we perform in experiments are equal
to averages over many independent realisations of the same system (used in
computations). Besides the fact that cities and systems are systems of cities
are out-of-equilibrium systems, Pumain does not explicit what averages she is
refering to. The ergodic objection does not hold in this case, although it does
raise interesting questions in the case of the out-of-equilibrium model
presented in the previous chapter. But still, the critique is justified, and
scalings have indeed little to do with city growth.

Furthermore, the growth rate predicted by their differential equation strongly
depends on the size of the city considered. It is however an empirical fact that
the relative growth rate of cities $\mathrm{d}P / P$ should be independent (or
weakly dependent on) city size.

\subsection{A property of cities, or systems of cities?}
\label{sub:a_property_of_cities_or_systems_of_cities_}



The second assumption, never really stated, is that the
processes responsible for the city-wide value of the quantity being studied
occur over time-scales that are at most of the same order of the time-scales
over which population changes. A very fast increase in population size, for
instance, is not likely to be immediately reflected in terms of the length of
streets, for instance. Of all the deviations measured by Bettencourt et al, it
is difficult to say whether these deviations account for a real over or
under-performance of the city compared to the other cities in the system, or
just for the time-delay in the studied quantity to react to population
changes. In fact, these questions cannot be answered until we understand the
evolution of these quantities in time.

\paragraph{On systems of cities} The fact that we observe scalings when taking a
single country into account, and a cloud of points when mixing two different
countries, is a signature of the integration of cities into systems of
cities. Although it is not clear at the moment what are the mechanisms
reponsible for the 'equilibration' of the scaling there clearly is an
adjustement that is being made, because the economy, the population, etc. are
tightly connected through the flow of commodities, populations, information and
funds.

\paragraph{And the ergodic counter-argument?} Pumain in~\cite{Pumain:2012} argues that
transversal averages are usable to describe the time-evolution of individual
cities if and only if the trajectories of cities are egodic (which they clearly
aren't). This argument is misguided, and based on several misunderstandings of
what scalings represent, and the role of ergodicity in physical theories.
Although prompt to deplore the lack of knowledge of the existing geography
literature physicists have, we have to deplore on our side the improper use of
several concepts borrowed from physics, and the sometimes improper use of
mathematics and the latest developpements in some branches of physics (network
theory for instance). This is not an attack, this is just to point out that no
side is free form reproaches, and time wasted on criticising one another for
improper use of the literature would be put to better use if spent on teaching
these things to one another.
\section{Scaling and system of cities}
\label{sec:scaling_and_system_of_cities}

We briefly mentionned in the introduction that allometric scaling relationships
could only be obtained when considering cities belonging to the same system of
cities. Indeed, if we mix on the same plot cities from two different countries,
say North-American cities with African cities, it is very likely that we would
obtain very different results. Based on this observation, several questions
arise: First, how does the $Y$ quantity at the level of a country (system)
depend on the properties of its system of cities? How can we understand the
quantity $Y_0$, and how can we sensibly normalise the scaling curves of
different systems of cities to compare their respective trends?

\section{Proviso}
\label{sec:poviso}

Scaling laws are useful tool to probe the system city, but they are not
everything. They provide an extraordinarily easy way to explore the properties
of urban systems: the amount of data required is minimal, the treatment
trivial. However, while it may be useful to declutter the investigation field
and help clear a couple of paths, and help establish a large-scale understanding
of the system, this is done at the expense of an extensive coverage of the
underlying phenomena. Scalings can be seen as a gateway to the study of cities,
but they cannot be the study itself.

The attentive reader might have noticed that I have attempted to be very careful
in specifying the city definition that was used in the different studies in the
