\subsection{Shortcomings of the current empirical picture}
\label{sub:shortcomings_of_the_current_empirical_picture}

There are many different ways in which a spatial pattern can deviate from its
randomised counterpart, and at least as many different measures one could
perform. In this chapter, we will try to quantify these patterns in a way that
allows to \emph{understand} the phenomenon of segregation. 

Of course, segregation has been extensively studied in the literature. However,
we identify several difficulties in the current empirical picture.\\


First, some issues are tied to the existence of several categories in the
underlying data. Historically, measurements of racial segregation were limited
to measures between $2$ population groups. However, most measures generalise
poorly to a situation with many groups, and the others do not necessarily have a
clear interpretation~\cite{Reardon:2002}. Worse, in the case of groups based on
a continuum (such as income), the thresholds chosen to define classes are
usually arbitrary~\cite{Jargowsky:1996}. We propose to solve this issue by
defining classes in a unambiguous and non-arbitrary way through their pattern of
spatial interaction. Applied to the distribution of income categories in US
cities, we find $3$ emergent categories, which are naturally intepreted as the
lower-, middle- and higher-income classes.\\

Second, most authors systematically design a single index of segregation for
territories that can be very large, up to thousands of square
kilometers~\cite{Apparicio:2000}. In order to mitigate segregation, a more
local, spatial information is however needed: local authorities need to locate
where the poorest and richest concentrate if they want to design efficient
policies to curb, or compensate for, the existing segregation. Furthermore, 
a local description of the repartition of the different categories is the first
step towards the exploration of the mechanisms responsible for segregation: it
is necessary to gather hints, as well as empirical regularities that are
essential to build a reasonable model. 

In other words, we need to provide a clear {\it spatial} information on the
pattern of segregation.\\



The lack of clear spatial characterization of the distribution of individuals is
not tied to the problem of segregation in particular, but pertains to the field
of spatial statistics~\cite{Ripley:1981}. Many studies avoided this spatial
problem by considering cities as monocentric and circular, and rely on either an
arbitrary definition of the city center boundaries, or on indices computed as a
function to the distance to the center (whatever this may be). However, most if
not all cities are anistropic, and the large ones, polycentric
(see Chapter~\ref{chap:monocentric_introduction}), casting some doubt about
the application of the monocentric city picture. Many empirical studies and
models in economics aim to explain the difference between central cities and
suburbs \cite{Glaeser:2008, Brueckner:1999}. Yet, the sole stylized fact upon
which they rely -- city centers tend to be poorer than suburbs (in the US) --
lacks a solid empirical basis.\\

In the following, we propose to answer the following question

\begin{itemize}
    \item How can we quantify the presence of the different categories in areal
        units? Can we say whether they are overrepresented or normally
        represented? How can we define neighbourhoods?
    \item How can we quantify the interactions between the different categories?
    \item How to define meaningful classes from the original data?
    \item Do classes tend to leave in geographically coherent areas, or are they
        scattered across the city?
    \item Is there a difference between the city center and the suburbs? How
        can we quantify this properly?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notations}
\label{sub:notations}

Data present themselves as the population sorted in different categories, and in
different tracts. There are $N$ individuals and  $T$ tracts in the considered geographical area, and
we note $N_\alpha$ the number of individuals belonging to the category $\alpha$.
Finally, we write $n(t)$ the total number of individuals living in the tract
$t$, and $n_\alpha(t)$ the total number of individuals who belong to category
$\alpha$ living in the tract $t$.



\section{Presence of categories}
\label{sec:presence_of_categories}

Maybe the most fundamental quantity in all studies of segregation is how we
quantify the presence of a category in areal units. Indeed, most measures
presuppose a way to measure presence. Several indicators exist, and one needs to be
aware of their meaning, their qualities and their shortcomings. Per se, if one's
goal is to indentify areal units with high levels of segregation everything else
being equal, one should use the representation defined below. Other measures can
have their use, but are biaised and thus cannot be used for an assessment of
segregation.

\subsection{Concentration}
\label{sub:concentration}


The concentration measures the proportion of individuals from category $\alpha$
in the areal unit $t$. 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{n_\alpha(t)}{N_\alpha}
\end{equation}

The concentration has the nice property to be composition-invariant, that is it
does not depend on the relative proportion of category $\alpha$ in the
geographical zone as a whole. 

However, it strongly depends on the total population of the areal unit we are
studying: more population areal units will mechanically lead to higher values of
the concentration. Segregation measures based on the concentration (such as the
dissimilarity index) will thefore be dominated by the values in highly
population areal units.

\subsection{Proportion}
\label{sub:proportion}

Sometimes, however, we prefer to know the proportion of people of a given
category in an unit. In our notations, it is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{n_\alpha(t)}{n(t)}
\end{equation}

Although the values of the proportion are easier to interpret (`x% of the
individuals living in this areal units live in this neighbourhood'), they are
not a good indicator of segregation. They strongly depend on the relative
proportion of individuals of the category in the geographical area being
studied. 

\subsection{An unbiaised measure: representation}
\label{sub:an_unbiaised_measure_the_representation}

The representation solves the problems linked to both measures of concentration
and of representation. The idea behind the measure of representation is that
segregation is a departure from the situation where all categories would be
spatially distributed at random. The properties of such a `random', unsegregated
city are however well known, and the distribution of categories in each areal
unit is given by a binomial distribution (as we introduced in the previous
chapter). The representation is thus defined as
the number $n_\alpha(t)$ divided by its expected value in an unsegregated city

\begin{equation}
    r_\alpha(t) = \frac{n_\alpha(t)/n(t)}{N_\alpha/N}
\end{equation}

In the perfectly unsegregated city (number of individuals equal to the mean of
the binomial distribution), $r_\alpha = 1$. Of course, there always is a
possibility for any situation that it has been obtained by chance. Given the
binomial distribution, however, we can compute how likely it is that the
representation $r_\alpha(t)$ we measure has been obtained by chance. To do that,
we first compute the variance:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Var}\left[r_\alpha(t)\right] = \sigma_\alpha(t)^2 = \frac{1}{N_\alpha} \left[\frac{N}{n(t)} - 1\right]
\end{equation}

we would like to know the areal units that depart \emph{significantly} from the
random situation. We conservatively define \emph{significant} as meaning that we
can be sure with $99\%$ confidence that the pattern has not been obtained at
random. Therefore, we will say that  

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha$ is overrepresented in $t$ iff $r_\alpha(t) > 1 +
  2.57\,*\sigma_\alpha(t)$
    \item $\alpha$ is underrepresented in $t$ iff $r_\alpha(t) < 1 +
  2.57\,\sigma_\alpha(t)$
\end{itemize}

Note that the expression of the representation (Eq. \ref{eq:repre}) is very
similar to the formula used in economics to compute comparative
advantages~\cite{Balassa:1965}, or to the localisation quotient used in various
contexts~\cite{Apparicio:2000, Schwabe:2011}. To our knowledge, however, this
formula has never been justified by a null model in the context of residential
location. The representation allows to assess the significance of the deviation
of population distributions from the unsegregated city. As we will show below,
it is also the building block for measuring the level of repulsion or attraction
between populations -- allowing us to uncover the different classes -- and to
identify the neighbourhoods where the different categories concentrate. Last,
but not least, the representation defined here does not depend on the class
structure at the city scale, but only on the spatial repartition on individuals
belonging to each class. This is essential to be able to compare different
cities where the group compositions -- or inequality -- might differ. Inequality
and segregation are indeed two separate concepts, and the way they are measured should
be distinct from one another. 

\section{Measuring the attraction and repulsion of categories}
\label{sec:measuring_the_attraction_and_repulsion_of_categories}

Existing measures do not allow to quantify to which extent different populations
attract or repel one another. It is however important to understand the dynamics
and importance of residential segregation. The meaure we define is inspired by
the M-value first introduced by Marcon \& Puech in the economics
literature~\cite{Marcon:2009} and used as a measure of interaction in
\cite{Jensen:2006}.  These authors were interested in measuring the geographic
concentration of different type of  industries. While previous measures (such as
Ripley's K-value) allow to identify departures from a random (Poisson)
distribution, the M-value's interest resides in the possibility to evaluate
different industries' tendency to co-locate. The idea, in the context of
segregation is simple. We consider two categories $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and we
would like to measure to which extent they are co-located in the same areal
unit. Essentially, we measure the representation of the category $\beta$ as
witnessed on average by the individuals in category $\alpha$, and obtain the following quantity $E_{\alpha\beta}$

\begin{equation} 
    E_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{1}{N_\alpha} \sum_{t=1}^{T} n_\alpha(t)\,r_\beta(t) 
\end{equation}

Although it is not obvious with this formulation, this measure is symmetric:
$E_{\alpha \beta} = E_{\beta \alpha}$ (see Supporting Information). Effectively, the E-value in this context is a measure of exposure,
according to the typology of segregation measures found in~\cite{Massey:1988}.
It is however different form the traditional measure of exposure found in the
literature~\cite{Bell:1954} in that it allows to distinguish the contexts in
which categories attractof repel one another.

In the case of an unsegregated city, every household in $\alpha$ sees
on average $r_\beta = 1$ and we have $E_{\alpha \beta} = 1$. If
populations $\alpha$ and $\beta$ {\em attract} one another, that is if
they tend to be overrepresented in the same areal units, every
household $\alpha$ sees $r_\beta > 1$ and we have
$E_{\alpha \beta} > 1$ at the city scale. On the other hand, is they
{\em repel} one another, every household $\alpha$ sees $r_\beta < 1$
and we have $E_{\alpha \beta} <1$ at the city scale. The minimum of
the exposure for two classes $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is obtained when
these two categories are never present together in the same areal unit
and then

\begin{equation}
    E_{\alpha\,\beta}^{min} = 0 
\end{equation}

and the maximum is obtained when the two classes are isolated from the other
individuals, but are otherwise indifferent to their location in the remaining
areal units (see the Supporting Information for more details). In this case we get

\begin{equation}
    E_{\alpha\,\beta}^{max} = \frac{N}{N_\alpha + N_\beta}
\end{equation}

[BEWARE OF THE MAXIMUM!]
In the case $\alpha = \beta$, the previous measure represents the
`isolation' defined as

\begin{equation}
    I_\alpha = \frac{1}{N_\alpha}\sum_{t=1}^{t} n_\alpha(t)\,r_\alpha(t)
\end{equation}

and measures to which extent individuals from the same category are
exposed to their kins. in the unsegregated city, where individuals are
indifferent to others when chosing their residence, we have
$I_\alpha^{min}=1$. on the other hand, in the extreme situation where
individuals belonging to the class $\alpha$ live isolated from the
others, the isolation reaches its maximum value

\begin{equation}
    I_\alpha^{max} = \frac{N}{N_\alpha}
\end{equation}

Of course, in order to discuss the significance of the values of exposure and
isolation, one needs to compute the variance of the exposure in the unsegregated
situation defined earlier. The calculations for the variance as well as for the
extrema are presented in the Supporting Information. [WATCH FOR THIS ONE]

\section{Emergent social classes}
\label{sec:the_emergent_social_classes}

The study of segregation must be rooted in a particular definition of categories
(or classes). There is however no consensus in the literature about how to
separate households in different classes according to their income, and studies
generally rely on more or less arbitrary divisions. While in some particular
cases grouping the original categories in pre-defined categories is justified,
most authors do so for mere convenience reasons. However, as some sociologists
have already pointed out~\cite{Emirbayer:1997}, imposing the existence of
absolute, artificial entities is necessarily going to skew our reading of the
data. Furthemore, in the absence of recognized standards, different authors will
likely have different definitions of classes, making the comparisons between
different results in the literature difficult. 

From a theoretical point of view, entities such as social classes do not have an
existence of their own. Grouping the individuals into arbitrary classes when
studying segregation is thus a logical fallacy: it amounts to imposing a class
structure on the society before assessing the existence of this structure (which
manifests itself by the differentiated spatial repartition of individuals with
different income, segregation). Here, instead of imposing an arbitrary class
structure , we let the class structure emerge from the data themselves. Our
starting hypothesis is the following: if there is such a thing as a social
stratification based on income, it should be reflected in the households'
behaviours. Households belonging to the same class should tend to live together,
while households belonging to different classes should tend to avoid one
another. The idea is thus to define classes based on the way they manifest
themselves through the spatial repartition of the different categories. 

We choose as a starting point the finest income subdivision given by the census
bureau ($16$ subdivisions) and compute the $16 \times 16$ matrix of $E_{\alpha
\beta}$ values for all cities. We then perform a hierarchical clustering on this
matrix, succesively aggregating the subdivisions with the highest $E_{\alpha
\beta}$ values. we stop the aggregation process when the only classes left are
indifferent ($E_{\alpha \beta} = 1$ with $99\%$ confidence) or
repel one another ($E_{\alpha \beta} < 1$ with $99\%$ confidence). The
aggregation procedure is explained in more details in the Supporting 
Information.

Strikingly, the outcome of this method is the emergence of 3 distinct classes:
the higher-income ($47\%$ of the US population) and the lower-income classes
($42\%$ of the US population) -- which repel one another strongly while being
respectively very coherent -- and a somewhat meagre middle-income class ($11\%$
of the population) that is relatively indifferent to the other classes. This
result implies that there is some truth in the conventional way of dividing
populations into $3$ income classes, and that what we casually perceive as the
social stratification in our cities actually emerges from the spatial
interaction of people. Our method has several advantages over a casual
definition however: it not arbitrary in the sense that it does not depend on a
tunable parameter and on who performs the analysis. Its origins are tractable,
and can be argued on a quantitative basis. Because it is quantitative, it allows
comparison of the stratification over different points in time, or between
different countries. It can also be compared to other class divisions that would
be obtained using a different medium for interaction, for instance mobile phone
communications~\cite{Eagle:2010}. In the following, we will systematically use
the classes thus obtained in our analyses.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/figure1.pdf}
    \caption{(a) Alluvial diagram showing the successive aggregations
      of different income categories in the clustering process, and
      the value of the exposure at which the aggregation took
      place. The aggregation stops when there is no pair of category
      for which $E>1$, that is when all classes are at best
      indifferent to one another (see the SI Appendix, section 2 for a more
      detailed description of the algorithm). One can see on this diagram that
      the highest income categories attract one another more (higher values of
      $E_{\alpha \beta}$) than the lowest income categories. (b) The classes that emerge from our
      analysis, and their respective exposure and isolation values. The lower
      and higher income classes repel one another, while the middle
      income class is indifferent to either other classes.  The
      higher-income class is more coherent than the lower-income,
      which is more coherent than the middle-income class, as
      reflected by the isolation coefficient $I$.}
\label{fig:classes_alluvial}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Larger cities are richer}
\label{sub:inter_urban}

At the scale of an entire country, segregation can manifest itself in the
unequal representation of the different income classes across the urban areas.
We plot on Figure~\ref{fig:inter-urban_representation} the ratio $
N_\alpha^{>}(H)/N^{>}(H)$ where $N^{>}(H)$ is the number of cities of
population greater than $H$, and $N_\alpha^{>}(H)$ the number of cities of
population greater than $H$ for which the class $\alpha$ is overrepresented.


A decreasing curve indicates that the category $\alpha$ tends to be
underrepresented in larger urban areas, while an increasing curve shows that the
category $\alpha$ tends to be overrepresented in larger urban areas.  The
representation is measured with respect to the total population at the US level.

There is a clear differentiation between cities: over the $276$ MSA in our
dataset, no city exhibit a number of households of the three different classes
that is representative from the US as a whole. Furthermore, the number of cities
where higher-income households are overrepresented increases with the size of
the cities, while the inverse trend is true for lower-income households.
Surprisingly, this effect is not visible using the Gini coefficient (see
Supporting Information for a detailed discussion).  Therefore, larger cities are not richer in the
sense that rich households tend to be overrepresented in large cities, and
underrepresented in small ones.

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/gini_income.pdf}
    \caption{Gini coefficient of the income distribution of the $280$ MSA in
    $2000$ versus the number of households in the city. As one can see, there is
no clear relationship.\label{fig:gini}}
\end{figure}

    \caption{Proportion of cities in which the different classes are
    overrepresented, as a function of the total population of the city. One can
    clearly see that as cities get larger rich people will
    be overrepresented and poor people underrepresented (compared to national
    levels). \label{fig:inter-urban_representation}}
\end{figure}


\section{Delineating neighbourhoods}
\label{sec:neighbourhoods}

\subsection{Defining neighbourhoods}
\label{sub:defining_neighbourhoods}

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/figure2.png}
    \caption{The neighbourhoods in Atlanta for the three different
      income category. In black, the tracts where the corresponding
      class is overrepresented, in white where it is
      underrepresented and in grey where its value is
      undistinguishable from the random distribution. All
      MSA defined for the $2000$ Census exhibit a total exclusion between
      lower-income and higher-income
      neighbourhoods: the pictures for lower- and higher-income classes are the
      perfect negative of one another. In contrast, middle-income households
      are scattered across the city and exhibit very little geographical coherence.}
\label{fig:atlanta_neighbourhoods}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Clustering}
\label{sub:clustering}

Intra-tract measures such as the exposure are not enough to quantify
segregation. Indeed, areal units where a given class is overrepresented can
arrange themselves in different ways, without the intra-tract measures of
seggregation being affected~\cite{White:1983}. In order to illustrate this, we
consider the schematic cases represented on Figure~\ref{fig:checkerboard}, and
assume that  they are obtained by reshuffling the various squares around.
Obviously, the checkerboard on the left depicts a very different segregation
situation from the divided situation on the right while intra-tract measures
would give identical results.


A way to distinguish between different spatial arrangements is then to measure
how clustered the overrepresented areal units are. We first aggregate adjacent
overrepresented areal units (for a given class) leading to consistent
neighbourhoods. The ratio of the number $N_n$ of neighborhoods (clusters) to the
total number $N_o$ of overrepresented areal units measures the level of
clustering and in 

\begin{equation} 
    C = \frac{N_{o}-N_{n}}{N_{o}-1} 
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/figure5.pdf}
    \caption{Three situations that are identical for intra-areal unit measures,
        but that represent different segregation levels. (Left) The checkerboard
        city popularised by White~\cite{White:1983}, corresponding to a
        clustering value of $C=0$ for the black squares. (Middle) An
        intermediate situation between the checkerboard and the divided city,
        corresponding to $C \approx 0.86$.(Right) The divided city, corresponding to
        $C=1$. \label{fig:checkerboard}} 
\end{figure}

such that this quantity is $C = 0$ in a checkerboard-like situation, and $C = 1$
when all areal units form a unique neighbourhood. We show on
Figure~\ref{fig:clustering} the distibution of $C$ for the three classes over all
cities in our dataset. As one could infer from the maps on
Figure~\ref{fig:atlanta_neighbourhoods}, the rich and poor areal units are well
clustered, with a respective average clustering of $C = 0.80$ and $C = 0.74$.
The Middle class is on the other hand less coherent, with a average clustering
$C = 0.55$.\\


If a given class is overrepresented in a neighbourhood, it does not however mean
that most of the individuals belonging to this class live in this neighbourhood.
We compute the ratio of households of each income class that lives in a
neighbourhood over the total number of individuals in the income class (for
rich, poor, and middle class).  Results (Supporting Information) indicate that
essentially less than $50\%$ of each class live in their neighbourhood, while
the rest is dispatched over the rest of the city. The average concentration
decreases from higher-income individuals ($50\%$), to lower-income ($48\%$) and
middle-income individuals ($32\%$).\\

Finally, large values of clustering can hide different situations. We
could have on one hand a `giant' neighbourhood and several isolated areal units, which
would essentially mean that each class concentrates in a unique
neighbourhoods. Or on the other hand, several neighbourhoods of
similar sizes, meaning that the different classes concentrate in
several neighbourhoods across the city. In order to distinguish
between the two situations, we plot

\begin{equation} 
    P = H_{N_1} / H_{N_2} 
\end{equation}

where $H_{N_1}$ is the population of the largest neighbourhood, and $H_{N_2}$
the population of the second largest neighbourhood. The results are shown on
Figure~\ref{fig:clustering}, and again show a different behaviour for the
middle-income on one side, and higher-income and lower-income on the other side.
The size of the middle-income neighbourhoods are more balanced, with on average
$P=0.62$.  Higher- and lower-income neighbourhoods, on the other hand, are
dominated by one big neighbourhoods, with respectively on average $P=0.22$ and
$P=0.26$.


 \subsection{Scaling of neighbourhoods}
       \label{ssub:dependence_on_city_size}
       
The clustering values are high, indicating that the neighbourhoods occupied by
households of different classes are very coherent. We can now wonder whether
there is an effect of the city size on the number of neighbourhoods. We plot on
Figure~\ref{fig:number_clusters_class} the number of neighbourhoods found for all
three classes as a function of population. For each class, The curve is
well-fitted by a powerlaw function of the form

\begin{equation}
    N_n = b\,H^\beta
\end{equation}

where the exponent $\beta$ is less than one and depends on the class, 
indicating that there are proportionally less neighbourhoods
in larger cities (the number areal units scales proportionally with the
population size). In other words, different classes become more spatially
coherent as the population increases (see Supporting Information for more
details). The values of the exponents are

\begin{align*}
    \beta_{H} = 0.80\\
    \beta_{L} = 0.87\\
    \beta_{M} = 0.90\\
\end{align*}

These values show that the tendency to cluster as the city size increases is greater
for higher-income households than for lower- and middle-income households.\\

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/figure6.pdf}\\
    \caption{(Top) Distribution of the value of the clustering coefficient for
        all cities in our dataset, for the 3 classes. The higher income class

        $\overline{C} = 0.90$, followed by the lower income class with on
        average $\overline{C} = 0.87$. The Middle income class households are
        significantly less clustered than the previous two, with $\overline{C} =

        $26\%$ the size of the largest one, respectively. Middle-income
        households tend to be more dispersed, with a secondary neighbourhood that is on
        average $62\%$ of the size of the largest.} \label{fig:clustering}

    range between $0.88$ (higher-income) and $0.96$ (middle-income). Combined with the linear
    increase of the number of over-represented units with the number of
    households (see SI Appendix),
this sub-linear increase in the number of neighbourhoods shows the tendency of
classes to cluster more as cities get larger.\label{fig:number_clusters_class}}

\section{Poor centers, rich suburbs?}
\label{sec:poor_centers_rich_suburbs_}

In many studies, the question of the spatial pattern of segregation is limited
to the study of the center versus suburb and is usually adressed in two
different ways. First, a central area is defined by arbitrary boundaries and
measures are performed at the scale of the so-called center and at the scale of
the  rest, labelled as `suburbs'. The issue with this approach is that the
conclusions depend on the chosen boundaries and there is no unique unambiguous
definition of the city center: while some consider it to be the Central Business
District~\cite{Glaeser:2008}, others choose to define the center as the urban
core (urbanized area), where the population density is higher. The second
approach, in an attempt to get rid of arbitrary boundaries, consists in plotting
indicators of wealth as a function of distance to the
center~\cite{Glaeser:2008}. This approach, inspired by the monocentric and
isotropic city of many economic studies such as the Von Thunen or the
Alonso-Muth-Mills model~\cite{Brueckner:1987}, has however a serious flaw:
cities are not isotropic and are spread unevenly in space, leading to very
irregular shapes~\cite{Makse:1995}. Representing any quantity versus the
distance to a center thus amounts to average over very different areas and in
clear polycentric cases (as it is the case for large cities
~\cite{Louf:2013_polycentric})
is necessarily misleading. The notion of distance to the center is indeed
meaningless in polycentric situations.\\


We propose here a different approach that does not require the
definition of a distance to the center. Instead, we plot the average
representation computed over all areal units (census-blocks in this
dataset) with a given density population $\rho$.


Our findings shed a new light on the difference of social composition
between the high-density and low-density areas in cities. As shown on
Figure~\ref{fig:high_low_densities}, we find that on average,
low-density regions in cities are on average rich neighbourhoods,
although the effect is less pronounced as in the center. There is
however a surprising result: areas with very large densities
(typically above $20,000$ inhabitant$/\text{km}^2$) are on average
rich neighbourhoods. While slightly lower densities are on average poor
neighbourhoods. Only few cities in the US have neighborhoods that
reach the threshold of $20,000$ inhabitants per km$^2$, which can
explain why we observe in most cases poor centers and rich suburbs. We
can wonder whether the difference usually discussed between north
american and european cities does not come, in fact, from differences
in terms of densities.

  suburbs) are rich, while high density regions (the center) are poor,
  confirming empirically on a large dataset a stylized facts that had previously
  emerged from local studies. Interestingly, we also
  find that  very large density areas ($\rho>20,000/km^2$) are rich on average,
  suggesting that density may be one relevant factor in explaining the
  differences between neighbourhoods~\cite{Jacobs:1961}.

\section{Conclusion and perspective}
\label{sec:conclusion_and_perspective}

Instead of attempting to define segregation by enumerating its different aspects, we took
a radically different -- yet simpler -- of defining what segregation is not.
This naturally lead to defining the measure of representation, which is used in
turn to delineate neighbourhoods. We further defined the exposure (still based
on the representation), which measures the extent to which different categories
attract, repel or are indifferent to one another.

We then showed that we can define classes in a non-parametric way and 3 main
income classes emerged for the 2000 US Census data. The middle-income class
corresponds to a smaller income range than what is usually admitted, a curiosity
that certainly deserves further investigations. In terms of spatial arrangement,
although the fraction of the population that is contained in neighbourhoods does
not change with city size, the neighbourhoods are geographically more coherent
as cities get larger, which corresponds in effect to an increased level of
segregation as the size of the city increases. The behaviors of different
categories are very coherent and we showed that we could simplify the
description of these complex systems by considering a small number of categories
only. This is an important piece of information which will simplify the
description and modelling of stratification mechanisms.\\

Our results point to the intriguing fact that higher-income households are on
average overrepresented in very dense areas. Such high density areas are
relatively rare in the US, which might explain in part why we observe poor
centers and rich suburbs and rich centers essentially in Europe where the
density is very large. This result echoes Jacobs' analysis~\cite{Jacobs:1961}
that neighbourhoods with the highest dwelling densities usually are the ones
exhibiting the most vitality, and therefore the most attractive. Of course, high
densities are not everything, and some high-density neighbourhoods also are
lower-income neighbourhoods. Further investigations along these lines may
provide quantitative insights into the mechanisms leading to urban decline or
urban regeneration. 

In this study, we have tried to highlight the \emph{spatial} pattern of
segregation.  We believe that the identification of neighbourhoods that our
method permits will allow a finer-scale investigation of these spatial patterns.
The fundamental issue that runs beneath, however,  is the need for a useful, simplified
description of spatial density. A problem yet to be solved, but
that has a huge potential of applications. We note that the problem is tightly
linked, if not identical, to the one we encountered while trying to describe the
spatial distribution of density in Chapter~\ref{chap:monocentric}.
