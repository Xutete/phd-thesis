\chapter{Patterns of segregation}
\label{sec:concepts}


\section{Presence of categories}
\label{sec:presence_of_categories}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{n_\alpha(t)}{N_\alpha}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \frac{n_\alpha(t)}{n(t)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{An unbiaised measure: representation}
\label{sub:an_unbiaised_measure_the_representation}

\begin{equation}
    r_alpha(t) = \frac{n_\alpha(t)/n(t)}{N_\alpha/N}
\end{equation}

\section{Measuring the attraction and repulsion of categories}
\label{sec:measuring_the_attraction_and_repulsion_of_categories}

\begin{equation}
    E_{\alpha \beta}(t) = \frac{1}{N_\alpha}
    \sum_{t=1}^T\,n_\alpha(t)\,r_\beta(t) 
\end{equation}

The measure of exposure is symmetric, $E_{\alpha \beta}(t) = E_{\beta \alpha}(t)$

\section{The emergent social classes}
\label{sec:the_emergent_social_classes}


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/figure1.pdf}
    \caption{(a) Alluvial diagram showing the successive aggregations
      of different income categories in the clustering process, and
      the value of the exposure at which the aggregation took
      place. The aggregation stops when there is no pair of category
      for which $E>1$, that is when all classes are at best
      indifferent to one another (see the SI Appendix, section 2 for a more
      detailed description of the algorithm). One can see on this diagram that
      the highest income categories attract one another more (higher values of
      $E_{\alpha \beta}$) than the lowest income categories. (b) The classes that emerge from our
      analysis, and their respective exposure and isolation values. The lower
      and higher income classes repel one another, while the middle
      income class is indifferent to either other classes.  The
      higher-income class is more coherent than the lower-income,
      which is more coherent than the middle-income class, as
      reflected by the isolation coefficient $I$.}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/gini_income.pdf}
    \caption{Gini coefficient of the income distribution of the $280$ MSA in
    $2000$ versus the number of households in the city. As one can see, there is
no clear relationship.\label{fig:gini}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/figure3.pdf}
    \caption{Proportion of cities in which the different classes are
    overrepresented, as a function of the total population of the city. One can
    clearly see that as cities get larger rich people will
    be overrepresented and poor people underrepresented (compared to national
    levels). \label{fig:inter-urban_representation}}
\end{figure}




\section{Neighbourhoods}
\label{sec:neighbourhoods}



\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/figure2.png}
    \caption{The neighbourhoods in Atlanta for the three different
      income category. In black, the tracts where the corresponding
      class is overrepresented, in white where it is
      underrepresented and in grey where its value is
      undistinguishable from the random distribution. All
      MSA defined for the $2000$ Census exhibit a total exclusion between
      lower-income and higher-income
      neighbourhoods: the pictures for lower- and higher-income classes are the
      perfect negative of one another. In contrast, middle-income households
      are scattered across the city and exhibit very little geographical coherence.}
\label{fig:atlanta_neighbourhoods}

\section{Clustering and concentration}
\label{sec:clustering_and_concentration}



\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/figure5.pdf}
    \caption{Three situations that are identical for intra-areal unit measures,
        but that represent different segregation levels. (Left) The checkerboard
        city popularised by White~\cite{White:1983}, corresponding to a
        clustering value of $C=0$ for the black squares. (Middle) An
        intermediate situation between the checkerboard and the divided city,
        corresponding to $C \approx 0.86$.(Right) The divided city, corresponding to
        $C=1$. \label{fig:checkerboard}} 
\end{figure}


\begin{figure} 
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/figure6.pdf}\\
    \caption{(Top) Distribution of the value of the clustering coefficient for
        all cities in our dataset, for the 3 classes. The higher income class
        exhibits the highest level of clustering, with an average of
        $\overline{C} = 0.90$, followed by the lower income class with on
        average $\overline{C} = 0.87$. The Middle income class households are
        significantly less clustered than the previous two, with $\overline{C} =
        0.56$ on average.  (Bottom) Distribution of the ratio of the size of the
        largest and second largest neighbourhoods for each class for all cities in our
        datset. Higher- and lower-income househols tend to concentrate in single
        neighbourhood, with a secondary center that is on average $22\%$ and
        $26\%$ the size of the largest one, respectively. Middle-income
        households tend to be more dispersed, with a secondary neighbourhood that is on
        average $62\%$ of the size of the largest.} \label{fig:clustering} 
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/figure7.pdf}
    \caption{Number of neighbourhoods for the three different classes as a
    function of the size of the city. These plots in loglog show that
    we have a behavior consistent with a power law with exponent less
    than one (and with different value for each class), with $R^2$ values that
    range between $0.88$ (higher-income) and $0.96$ (middle-income). Combined with the linear
    increase of the number of over-represented units with the number of
    households (see SI Appendix),
this sub-linear increase in the number of neighbourhoods shows the tendency of
classes to cluster more as cities get larger.\label{fig:number_clusters_class}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./gfx/chapter-segregation/number_overrepresented.pdf}
    \caption{Number of areal units where each class is overrepresented as a
    function of the total number of households in the city. The behaviour is
consistent with a linear behaviour in the three cases.
\label{fig:overrepresented}}
\end{figure}


\section{Poor centers, rich suburbs?}
\label{sec:poor_centers_rich_suburbs_}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/figure4.pdf}
    \caption{Average representation of the higher-, middle- and
      lower-income classes over the $276$ MSA as a function of the
      local density of households. On average, we find that low-density (the
  suburbs) are rich, while high density regions (the center) are poor,
  confirming empirically on a large dataset a stylized facts that had previously
  emerged from local studies. Interestingly, we also
  find that  very large density areas ($\rho>20,000/km^2$) are rich on average,
  suggesting that density may be one relevant factor in explaining the
  differences between neighbourhoods~\cite{Jacobs:1961}.

\section{A new measure of segregation}
\label{sec:a_new_measure_of_segregation}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/index_distribution.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of $e = \frac{L_m}{H\,\sqrt{A}}$ for one realisation
    of the null model for the $\sim 900$ CBSAs in the US. The measure nicely
spans the range $\left[ 0.2, 1 \right]$ with a single town above one (understand
why). \label{fig:label_fig}}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/distance_scaling.pdf}
    \caption{Distance that households would have to move as a
    function of the number of households that would have to move, normalised by
    the typical size of the city they're in. The sublinear
scaling indicates that as cities get larger, households would have to travel a
shorter distance.\label{fig:label_fig}}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gfx/chapter-segregation/moved_scaling}
    \caption{Number of people that would have to move to get to the quilibrium
    state as a function of the total population. \label{fig:label_fig}}
\end{figure}


\begin{equation}
    U_\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^T \left| n_\alpha(t) -
    N_\alpha\,\frac{n(t)}{N}\right|
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    e = \frac{L_\alpha}{N_\alpha\,D}
\end{equation}

where $L_\alpha$ is the total distance that individuals belonging to the class
$\alpha$ should travel when relocating to obtain a uniform city.
