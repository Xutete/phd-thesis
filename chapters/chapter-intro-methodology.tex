\section{In defense of reductionism}
\label{sec:in_defense_of_reductionism}

In fact, we do not need to have a full theoretical description of the human mind
to say something about the actions of hundreds of thousands, a million of them.
In the same way we do not need string theory in order to explain the
functioning of living organisms.

\section{Against data}
\label{sec:against_data}

In `Againt Method', the philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend argued against
the idea that Science proceeds through the application of a single, monolithic
method; what people usually call `The Scientific Method'. The reference is not
innocent, and I will argue here that, although empirical analysis constitutes
the alpha and the omega of our enquiry for knowledge, data are not enough.
